# wampy

## An experimental (and incomplete) WAMP Implementation.

The WAMP protocol connects Clients over RPC or pub/sub via a Router. A Client is some kind of application, maybe a *Caller*, maybe a *Callee*, else a *Publisher* or a *Subscriber*. A *Router* is another type of application - a message broker - and highly likely to be Crossbar.

Whatever application you're dealing with, WAMP refers to these as a __Peer__.

With __wampy__ you can create Peers to implement WAMP roles: Callee, Caller, Publisher, Subscriber, Broker and Dealer.

### Quickstart: wampy from a Python console.

Before any messaging can happen you need a Peer to implement the Dealer or Broler roles, or both.

For example, using the built-in Crossbar router to act as an RPC Dealer.

	In [1]: from wampy.testing.routers import Crossbar

	In [2]: crossbar = Crossbar(
	   ...: 	host='localhost',
       ...: 	config_path='./wampy/testing/routers/config.json',
       ...: 	crossbar_directory='./'
       ...: )

    In [3]: crossbar.start()

    ... watch plenty of Crossbar.io logging ouput fly by....

A client (either a Caller or a Callee) can then begin a Session with the Router.

	In [4]: from wampy.peers.clients import WampClient

	In [5]: class DateService(WampClient):
	   ...: 	""" A service that tells you todays date """
	   ...: 	
	   ...: 	@property
	   ...: 	def name(self):
	   ...: 	    return 'Date Service'
	   ...: 	
	   ...: 	@rpc
	   ...: 	def get_todays_date(self):
	   ...: 	    logger.info('getting todays date')
	   ...: 	    return datetime.date.today().isoformat()

	In [6]: from wampy.constants import DEFAULT_REALM, DEFAULT_ROLES

	In [7]: service = DateService(
	   ...:		name="Date Service", router=crossbar,
	   ...: 	realm=DEFAULT_REALM, roles=DEFAULT_ROLES,
	   ...: )

	In [8]: service.start()

	In [9]: service.session.id
	Out[9]: 3941615218422338

If a Peer implements the "Callee" Role, then by starting the Peer you instruct the Peer to register its RPC entrypoints with the Router.

	In [10]: service.role
	Out[10]: 'CALLEE' 

	In [11]: from wampy.registry import get_registered_entrypoints
	Out[11]: {347361574427174: (wampy.testing.clients.callees.DateService, 'get_todays_date')}

Any method of the Peer decorated with @rpc will have been registered as publically availabile over the Router.

	In [12]: from wampy.peers.clients import RpcClient

	In [13]: client = RpcClient(
	    ...: 	name="Caller", router=crossbar,
	    ...: 	realm=DEFAULT_REALM, roles=DEFAULT_ROLES,
	    ...: )

The built in stand alone client knows about the entrypoints made available by the ``DateService`` and using it you can call them directly.

	In [14]: client.rpc.get_todays_date()
	Out [14]: u'2016-05-14'

When you're done playing, stop the Router, as it is running in a subprocess and needs to be managed carefully.

	In [15]: crossbar.stop()

	In [16]: exit()
