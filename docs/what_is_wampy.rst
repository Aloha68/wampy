What is wampy?
==============

This is a Python implementation of **WAMP** not requiring Twisted or asyncio, enabling use within classic blocking Python applications. It is a light-weight alternative to `autobahn`_.

With **wampy** you can quickly and easily create your own **WAMP** clients, whether this is in a web app, a microservice, a script or just in a Python shell.

**wampy** tries to provide an intuitive API for your **WAMP** messaging.
