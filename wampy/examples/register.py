    procedure with a Dealer by sending a "REGISTER" message ::

        [
            REGISTER, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri
        ]

    "Request" is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the _Callee_ and
    used to correlate the _Dealerâ€™s_ response with the request.

    "Options" is a dictionary that allows to provide additional
    registration request details in a extensible way.  This is
    described further below.

    "Procedure" is the procedure the _Callee_ wants to register

    If the _Dealer_ is able to fulfill and allowing the registration, it
    answers by sending a "REGISTERED" message to the "Callee" ::

        [
            REGISTERED, REGISTER.Request|id, Registration|id
        ]

    "REGISTER.Request" is the ID from the original request.

    "Registration" is an ID chosen by the _Dealer_ for the registration.

    e.g. ::

        [
            65, 25349185, 2103333224
